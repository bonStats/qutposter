# qutposter
Template for QUT and/or ACEMS poster

To use as a template for your poster, 
either click the green "Use this template" button above to copy to your github page, 
then pull to your local computer; or download the contents of this repository to use locally.

The poster is built on [posterdown](https://github.com/brentthorne/posterdown) which is a package built on top of [rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).

Here is an [example](https://github.com/bonStats/qutposter/blob/master/imgs/poster-example.pdf) of a poster I made with this template.

I recommend previwing the poster in Google chrome, and converting to a pdf with the chrome print dialog.
